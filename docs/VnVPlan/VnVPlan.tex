This document outlines the Verification and Validation (VnV) plan for Re-ProtGNN, a prototype-based interpretable Graph Neural Network. The objective of this plan is to ensure that the system meets the functional and non-functional requirements specified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). The document is structured as follows: Section 2 provides general information about Re-ProtGNN, including its objectives and scope. Section 3 details the verification strategies, covering SRS verification, design verification, and implementation verification. Section 4 describes the system tests, including functional and non-functional testing. Finally, Section 5 will cover additional test descriptions as needed.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The software under validation is Re-ProtGNN, a model designed to enhance the interpretability of Graph Neural Networks. It aims to classify graph-structured data while generating prototypes that explain its predictions. The system consists of two main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Training Phase: Learns meaningful representations of graphs while optimizing a loss function to improve both classification accuracy and prototype relevance.
    \item Inference Phase: Uses the trained model to classify unseen graphs and generate a set of representative prototypes that provide human-interpretable explanations.
\end{itemize}

Re-ProtGNN is implemented in Python, utilizing PyTorch Geometric for graph learning and Pytest for automated testing.


\subsection{Objectives}

The main goal of this VnV plan is to verify the correctness of the program, which is to ensure that the system correctly processes graph-structured inputs, trains models effectively, and generates prototype-based explanations.

%\begin{itemize}
    %\item Correctness: Ensure that the system correctly processes graph-structured inputs, trains models effectively, and generates meaningful prototype-based explanations.
    %\item Accuracy: Assess whether the model attains a minimum classification accuracy of 80\% on the MUTAG dataset and confirm that the selected prototypes align with expected graph representations.
    %item Interpretability: Validate that the extracted prototypes contribute to a clearer understanding of the modelâ€™s decision-making process.
%\end{itemize}

Out-of-Scope Objectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item External Library Verification: Core dependencies such as PyTorch and Torch-Geometric are presumed to be reliable and are not explicitly tested in this plan.
    \item Graph Encoder Validation: Graph encoders, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), are adopted from prior research, and their correctness is assumed without additional validation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}
This is a research project, but extras may be included if time permits.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The Re-ProtGNN project is supported by several key documents that ensure the system is properly designed, implemented, and validated. These documents include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem Statement: This document~\cite{yuanqi2025protgnn} introduces the motivation of Re-ProtGNN and the core problem it aims to solve.
    
    \item Software Requirements Specification (SRS): The SRS~\cite{Yuanqi_ReProtGNN_SRS} defines the functional and non-functional requirements of Re-ProtGNN, and it also outlines the expected behavior of the system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Plan}

This section outlines the Verification and Validation (VnV) plan for Re-ProtGNN. It starts with an introduction to the verification and validation team (Subsection~\ref{sec:vvt}), detailing the members and their roles. Next, it covers the SRS verification plan (Subsection~\ref{sec:srsvp}), followed by the design verification plan (Subsection ~\ref{sec:dvp}). The document then presents the VnV verification plan (Subsection~\ref{sec:vvp}) and the implementation verification plan (Subsection~\ref{sec:ivp}). Finally, it includes automated testing and verification tools (Subsection~\ref{sec:att}) and concludes with the software validation plan (Subsection~\ref{sec:svp}).
